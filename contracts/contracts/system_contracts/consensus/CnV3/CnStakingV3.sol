// Features
// Note that extra multisig operations are implemented in the `CnStakingV3MultiSig` contract.
// 1. Initialization
//   - Initialize the contract with the given parameters.
//   - Functions
//     - setStakingTracker: Set the initial stakingTracker address
//     - setGCId: Set the gcId
//     - setPublicDelegation: Set the public delegation contract and initialize the contract
//
// 2. Lockup stakes (Initial lockup)
//   - Initial lockup is a set of long-term fixed lockups.
//   - Admin must agree to the conditions for this contract to initialize.
//   - In CnStakingV3MultiSig, the all admins must agree to the conditions.
//   - KLAYs must be deposited for this contract to initialize.
//   - Functions
//     - reviewInitialConditions(): Agree to the initial lockup conditions
//     - depositLockupStakingAndInit(): Deposit required amount
//     - WithdrawLockupStaking: Withdraw unlocked amount
//
// 3. Non-lockup stakes (Delegated stake)
//   - Delegated stakes can be added or removed at any time.
//   - Delegated stakes can be added either by calling delegate() or sending
//     a transaction to this contract with nonzero KAIA (via fallback).
//   - If public delegation is enabled, only the public delegation contract can call staking functions.
//   - It takes STAKE_LOCKUP after withdrawal request to actually take out the KAIA.
//   - Functions
//     - delegate/receive: Stake KAIA to this contract
//     - ApproveStakingWithdrawal: Schedule a withdrawal
//     - CancelApprovedStakingWithdrawal: Cancel a withdrawal request
//     - withdrawApprovedStaking(): Take out the KAIA or cancel an expired withdrawal request.
//
// 4. Re-delegation
//   - Re-delegation is a process to move stakes from one CnStakingV3 contract to another.
//   - It can be initiated only by the public delegation contract.
//   - It's inactive by default and can be toggled by the owner. (isRedelegationEnabled)
//   - To prevent re-delegation hopping, the last re-delegation time is recorded.
//     Can't redelegate within STAKE_LOCKUP after the last re-delegation.
//     For example, let's assume an user redelegated from CnStakingV3 A to CnStakingV3 B.
//     Then, user cannot redelegate from CnStakingV3 B within STAKE_LOCKUP.
//   - In `handleRedelegation`, target CnStakingV3 will stake the received KAIA on behalf of the user using `stakeFor`,
//     and check if the balance is not changed after the call.
//   - Functions
//     - toggleRedelegation: Enable or disable re-delegation, can be called only when public delegation is enabled.
//     - redelegate: Move stakes to the target CnStakingV3 contract
//     - handleRedelegation: Handle re-delegation from departure CnStakingV3 contract
//
// 5. External accounts
//   - Several addresses constitute the identity of this CN.
//   - Among them, RewardAddress can be modified via CnStaking contract.
//   - Functions
//     - UpdateRewardAddress: Setup pendingRewardAddress
//     - acceptRewardAddress(): Request AddressBook to change reward address.
//     - UpdateStakingTracker: Change the StakingTracker contract to report stakes.
//     - UpdateVoterAddress: Change the Voter account and notify to StakingTracker.

// Code organization
// - Modifiers
// - Mutators
//   - Constructor and initializers
//   - Managing operations
//   - Generic facility
//   - Private helpers
//   - Other public functions
// - Getters
